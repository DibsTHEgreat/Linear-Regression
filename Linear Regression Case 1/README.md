# Linear-Regression Case 1: SAT Score vs. GPA Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains experiments with Linear Regression through various case studies using popular datasets.

### Objective
The goal of this analysis is to investigate the relationship between a student's SAT score and GPA score. Specifically, can we use a student's SAT score to predict their GPA after graduating from university?

### Methodology
I performed a linear regression analysis on the dataset to understand the correlation between SAT scores and subsequent university GPAs.

### Results
I observed a noticeable trend indicating that students who performed well in high school were more likely to perform well in university. In particular, a higher SAT score in high school correlated with a higher GPA after graduating from university.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that there is a positive relationship between high school SAT scores and university GPAs. This suggests that a student's performance in high school, as reflected in their SAT score, may serve as a reliable indicator of their academic success in university.
