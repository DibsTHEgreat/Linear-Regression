# Linear-Regression
In this folder I am experimenting with Linear Regression by doing a couple of case studies on practice datasets.

## Case 1: SAT Score vs. GPA Prediction
In this folder the goal is to investigate the relationship between a student's SAT score and GPA score. Specifically, can we use a student's SAT score to predict their GPA after graduating from university?

## Case 2: Real Estate Size vs. Price Prediction
In this folder the goal is to investigate the relationship between the size of a house and the price of a house. Specifically, can we use the size of the house to predict the price of the house?

## Case 3: SAT Score & Rand 1, 2, 3 vs. GPA Prediction
In this folder the goal is to investigate the change in the relationship between a student's SAT score and GPA score by introducing a new variable into the dataset called: Rand 1, 2, 3. Specifically, can we use a student's SAT score and Rand 1, 2, 3 to predict their GPA after graduating from university?
