# Linear-Regression

In this folder I am experimenting with Linear Regression by doing many case studies on popular datasets.

In the file: LinearRegression1, I am performing a linear regression to find the relationship between a student's SAT score and GPA score. Particularly, can we use a student's SAT score to predict a student's GPA after graduating from university. 
Results: I concluded that there was a noticeable trend between students that performed well in highschool also had a high likelyhood of performing well in university. Therefore, the higher the SAT score in highschool, the more likely the same individual would have a higher GPA after graduating from university.
