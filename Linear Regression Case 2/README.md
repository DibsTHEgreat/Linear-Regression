# Linear-Regression Case 2: Real Estate Size vs. Price Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains experiments with Linear Regression through a couple of case studies using practice datasets.

### Objective
The goal of this analysis is to investigate the relationship between the size of a house and its price. Specifically, can we use the size of a house to predict its price?

### Methodology
I performed a linear regression analysis on the dataset to understand the correlation between the size of houses and their prices.

### Results
I observed a clear trend indicating that as the size of a house increases, so does its price. Larger houses tend to have higher prices, suggesting a positive correlation between house size and price.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that there is a positive relationship between the size of a house and its price. This implies that the size of a house is a significant factor in determining its market value.
